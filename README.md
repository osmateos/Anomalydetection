# Anomalydetection

# Interface
  - run(Data, alpha=0.04) function is the main entry point 
  
  - Data =>  Ordered List[Any,Numeric] I.E ['2018-01-02',124]

> Alpha parameter can be altered to have more or less confidence (bigger alpha = bigger > > >confidence so more anomalies )
>In the current code is rendering a file with the graph and the anomaly point with markers, >this can be removed if the idea is to use from outside.
>Texfile1.txt is a example file to show the the process running.
